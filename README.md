# agenttoolkit

`agenttoolkit` provides one provider-neutral definition for tools exposed to
LLM agents. Define a tool once — schema, availability, metadata, and
execution logic — and expose it to OpenAI, Anthropic, or any other provider
without duplicating definitions.

It intentionally contains no application-specific tools and no agent loop:
it is a building block, not a framework.

## Features

- Registration through a `@tools.action` decorator — no hand-written JSON
  Schema, for either plain function signatures or Pydantic models.
- Runtime metadata (`effects`, `status`, `tags`, custom fields) and an
  `requires_approval` flag, kept out of the model-facing schema but readable
  by the host loop that dispatches calls.
- Context-based dependency injection (`Inject[T]`) so tools can receive
  application services without the model ever seeing them.
- Conditional tool availability and dynamic, context-aware descriptions.
- Sync and async tool execution behind a single async API.
- A composable middleware pipeline (error boundary, resolution, validation,
  logging) that applications can extend or replace.
- Thin, dependency-free schema adapters for OpenAI and Anthropic tool-call
  formats.
- Generic `ActionResult` type so applications can add project-specific
  result fields without falling back to `Any`.
- Async filesystem and shell ports with local, Docker, and Bubblewrap
  implementations for common agent capabilities.
- Local Agent Skills discovery and progressive loading, compatible with the
  `SKILL.md` convention.

## Installation

```console
uv add agenttoolkit
```

Requires Python 3.13–3.14. Modules that use forward references should add
`from __future__ import annotations`, since lazy annotation evaluation
(PEP 649) is native only to 3.14+.

## Quickstart

This is the shape of code you actually write and run — define tools with
the decorator, hand their schema to the model, execute whichever call it
makes, and feed the result back:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

from agenttoolkit import ActionResult, Inject, ToolContext, Tools, ToolSchemaFormat


class SearchParams(BaseModel):
    query: str = Field(description="What to search for")
    limit: int = Field(default=5, ge=1, le=20)


class SearchClient:
    async def search(self, query: str, limit: int) -> list[str]:
        return [query] * limit


tools = Tools(context=ToolContext(SearchClient()))


@tools.action(
    "Search the connected knowledge base.",
    params=SearchParams,
    status="Searching for {query}...",
)
async def search(params: SearchParams, client: Inject[SearchClient]) -> list[str]:
    return await client.search(params.query, params.limit)


# 1. Send the schema to the model.
schema = tools.get_schema(ToolSchemaFormat.ANTHROPIC)

# 2. The model asks to call "search" with {"query": "tool middleware"}.
result: ActionResult[object] = await tools.execute(
    "search", {"query": "tool middleware"}
)

# 3. Feed the outcome back to the model.
if result.ok:
    matches = result.result
else:
    error_message = result.error
```

`tools.execute(...)` never raises for expected failures — an unknown tool
name, invalid arguments, or an exception inside the tool all come back as a
failed `ActionResult`, ready to hand to the model as-is.

## Defining tools

The `@tools.action(...)` decorator is the entire surface most code touches.
Parameters come from a plain function signature or, for validation and
richer schemas, a Pydantic model passed as `params=`:

```python
@tools.action("Add two integers.")
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b


class RefundParams(BaseModel):
    order_id: str
    amount: float = Field(gt=0, description="Amount to refund, in USD")


@tools.action(
    "Issue a refund for an order.",
    params=RefundParams,
    effects=(ToolEffect.NETWORK,),
    status=lambda params: (
        f"Refunding {params.amount} for order {params.order_id}..."
    ),
    tags=["billing", "write"],
    requires_approval=True,
    metadata={"owner": "billing-team"},
)
def refund(params: RefundParams, client: Inject[BillingClient]) -> str:
    client.refund(params.order_id, params.amount)
    return "refunded"
```

None of `effects`, `status`, `tags`, `requires_approval`, or `metadata` are
visible to the model — they never appear in the generated JSON Schema. They
exist for the host loop that dispatches the call:

- `effects` — a `frozenset[ToolEffect]` declaring what a call does to the
  world (`READS_WORKSPACE`, `WRITES_WORKSPACE`, `NETWORK`,
  `SPAWNS_PROCESS`), readable as `tool.effects` or via
  `tool.has_effect(...)`. Effects let middleware and host policies react to
  behaviour rather than to tool names, which are part of the model-facing
  API and change over time.
- `status` — a human-readable status message, either a `str.format`
  template referencing parameter names or a callable. For callables, the
  parameter type is inferred from `params`, providing type checking and IDE
  navigation. Render it with `tool.format_status(args)` (e.g. to show
  "Refunding 20.0 for order o-123..." while the call runs).
- `tags` — a `frozenset[str]` for grouping or filtering tools, readable as
  `tool.tags`.
- `metadata` — an arbitrary read-only mapping for anything else the host
  application needs, readable as `tool.extra`.
- `requires_approval` — readable as `tool.requires_approval`; check it
  before calling `tools.execute(...)` if the action needs user
  confirmation first. `agenttoolkit` does not enforce approval itself.

```python
tool = tools.get("refund")
tool.effects             # frozenset({ToolEffect.NETWORK})
tool.tags                # frozenset({"billing", "write"})
tool.extra["owner"]      # "billing-team"
tool.requires_approval   # True
tool.format_status({"order_id": "o-123", "amount": 20.0})
# "Refunding 20.0 for order o-123..."
```

String `status` templates are validated against `params` at registration
time. Callable field access is checked statically by the IDE or type checker.

Prefer `tools.action(...)` for registering tools. Direct registration is an
internal implementation detail.

## Dependency injection with `ToolContext`

`ToolContext` carries application services that tools need but that should
never appear in the model-facing schema. Wrap a parameter in `Inject[T]` and
it is resolved from context at call time instead of being part of the
argument schema:

```python
context = ToolContext(SearchClient(), some_other_service)
tools.set_context(context)
```

`ToolContext.resolve(T)` returns the most recently provided instance of type
`T` (or a subclass), searching in reverse insertion order. Useful mutators:

```python
context.provide(extra_service)  # append more dependencies
context.without(SearchClient)   # drop instances of a type
context.clear()                 # remove everything
```

If an `Inject[T]` parameter has no default and no matching dependency is
found in context, execution raises `ValueError` rather than silently
passing `None`.

## Conditional availability and descriptions

Use `provided(...)` and `requires(...)` to expose a tool only when its
dependency is present (and, optionally, satisfies a predicate). Predicates
compose with `&`, `|`, and `~`:

```python
from agenttoolkit import provided, requires


@tools.action(
    "Issue a refund (admin only).",
    available_when=provided(BillingClient)
    & requires(UserInfo, predicate=lambda user: user.is_admin),
)
def refund(order_id: str, amount: float) -> str: ...
```

Use `description_from_context(...)` when a tool's description itself should
depend on context (e.g. embedding a resolved account name), with a fallback
for when the dependency isn't provided:

```python
from agenttoolkit import description_from_context

description = description_from_context(
    BankingClient,
    render=lambda client: f"Look up the balance for {client.account_name}.",
    fallback="Look up account balance.",
)


@tools.action(description)
def balance() -> float: ...
```

## Driving an agent loop

`Tools.get_schema(...)` returns the schema for every tool available in the
active (or a given) context; `Tools.execute(...)` dispatches a model-produced
call:

```python
openai_schemas = tools.get_schema(ToolSchemaFormat.OPENAI)
anthropic_schemas = tools.get_schema(ToolSchemaFormat.ANTHROPIC)

result = await tools.execute("search", {"query": "tool middleware"}, context=context)
```

A typical loop confirms approval-gated tools before executing, and reports
status while a call is in flight:

```python
tool = tools.get(name)
if tool is not None and tool.requires_approval and not confirm(name, arguments):
    result = ActionResult[object].fail("Declined by user")
else:
    print(tool.format_status(arguments) if tool else name)
    result = await tools.execute(name, arguments, context=context)
```

`Tools.get_available()` returns the underlying `Tool` objects for the active
registry context instead of schemas — handy for printing a catalog of what's
currently exposed (`tool.name`, `tool.resolve_description(context)`,
`tool.effects`, ...).

## Results (`ActionResult`)

```python
class ActionResult[ResultT = str](BaseModel):
    ok: bool
    result: ResultT | None = None
    error: str | None = None
```

`ResultT` defaults to `str`, the common case for a tool that hands text
back to the model. A bare `ActionResult` therefore *is* `ActionResult[str]`
and validates as one — `ActionResult.success(3)` raises. Payloads of any
other type must parametrize explicitly.

Raw tool return values are wrapped as successful results automatically. A
tool may instead return an `ActionResult` directly — e.g. to fail without
raising, or to populate a typed result:

```python
def run_command(command: str) -> ActionResult:  # ActionResult[str]
    result = shell(command)
    if not result.ok:
        return ActionResult.fail(result.output)
    return ActionResult.success(result.output)
```

```python
WeatherActionResult = ActionResult[WeatherResult]


def get_weather(city: str) -> WeatherActionResult:
    temp_c = KNOWN_CITIES.get(city.lower())
    if temp_c is None:
        return WeatherActionResult.fail(f"Unknown city: {city!r}")
    return WeatherActionResult.success(WeatherResult(city=city, temp_c=temp_c))
```

Because tool dispatch by name is dynamic and a registry can contain
heterogeneous return types, `Tools.execute()` always returns
`ActionResult[object]`; narrow `result` at the call site, or return a
specialized `ActionResult` directly from the tool as above.

`ActionResult` rejects unknown fields. When an application needs additional
result fields (trace IDs, citations, usage info), define them in a typed
subclass and wire it up via `Tools(result_type=...)` — every result the
middleware chain produces (validation failures, unknown-tool errors, the
internal-error fallback) is then built through that subclass too:

```python
class ProjectActionResult[ResultT = str](ActionResult[ResultT]):
    trace_id: str | None = None
    citations: tuple[str, ...] = ()


tools = Tools(result_type=ProjectActionResult[object])
```

## Middleware

Every call passes through a fixed core — error boundary, tool resolution,
argument validation — followed by call logging. Pass `middleware=` to run
additional steps between the core and logging, e.g. a timeout:

```python
from agenttoolkit import ToolCall, ToolMiddleware


class TimeoutMiddleware(ToolMiddleware):
    def __init__(self, seconds: float) -> None:
        self._seconds = seconds

    async def __call__(self, call: ToolCall, next):
        return await asyncio.wait_for(next(call), timeout=self._seconds)


tools = Tools(middleware=[TimeoutMiddleware(5.0)])
```

Custom middleware runs *after* resolution and validation, so `call.tool` and
`call.params` are already populated — which is what makes filtering on tool
metadata (see `effects` above) possible.

## Merging registries

Combine tools from multiple `Tools` instances — e.g. when composing a
registry from several feature modules:

```python
tools.merge(other_tools)               # raises on name collisions
tools.merge(other_tools, replace=True)  # other_tools wins on collisions
```

## Filesystem and shell primitives

`agenttoolkit.builtins` contains raw async implementations rather than a
predefined set of model-facing tools. Applications can use them directly,
inject them through `ToolContext`, or expose only the operations appropriate
for a particular agent.

```python
from pathlib import Path

from agenttoolkit.builtins import (
    BindMount,
    DockerSandbox,
    LocalWorkspace,
    SandboxPolicy,
)

workspace = LocalWorkspace("./project")
await workspace.write_file("src/example.py", "print('hello')\n")

entries = await workspace.list_dir("src")
source = await workspace.read_file(entries[0].path)

output = workspace.root / "output"
output.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
cli_config = Path.home() / ".config" / "my-cli"

policy = SandboxPolicy.for_workspace(
    workspace.root,
    writable=True,
    enable_network_access=True,
)
sandbox = DockerSandbox(
    "my-cli:latest",
    policy,
    inherit_environment=("MY_CLI_TOKEN",),
    mounts=(
        BindMount.read_only(cli_config, "/home/agent/.config/my-cli"),
        BindMount.read_write(output, "/output"),
    ),
    user="host",
)
result = await sandbox.execute("my-cli build --output /output")
```

The `Workspace` port provides `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `glob`,
`list_dir`, and `stat`. Exploration returns `Entry` values with a root-relative
POSIX path, directory and symlink flags, size, and modification time. Local
reads and writes are confined to the workspace root and bounded by a
configurable file-size limit.

The `Sandbox` port returns a common `SandboxResult` from all backends.
`SandboxPolicy` controls readable and writable paths, network access,
environment values, timeout, captured output, memory, process, and CPU limits.
`DockerSandbox` enforces all of these resource limits; `BubblewrapSandbox`
supports filesystem/network isolation and host-side timeout/output limits.
`UnsafeLocalSandbox` is useful for trusted commands but deliberately does not
claim to enforce path or network isolation.

`DockerSandbox` also supports named bind mounts and an explicit allowlist of
host environment variables. `BindMount.read_write(...)` writes directly back
to the host. `inherit_environment` fails fast when a requested variable is
missing and forwards its name without embedding the secret value in the
generated Docker arguments. On POSIX hosts, `user="host"` maps the container
process to the host UID and GID so generated files remain owned by the
developer. Use `environment={...}` on `SandboxPolicy` or `env={...}` on
`execute(...)` for explicit values and per-call overrides.

## Skills

Local Agent Skills are discovered from directories containing one
subdirectory per skill, each with a `SKILL.md` file using YAML frontmatter
(`name`, `description`, and optional `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`,
`allowed-tools`) followed by Markdown instructions:

```
skills/
  internet-research/
    SKILL.md
    references/
      guide.md
    scripts/
      search.py
```

`name` must be 1–64 lowercase letters, numbers, or hyphens, and must match
its parent directory name.

```python
from agenttoolkit import Skills

skills = Skills.from_local_dir("./skills")

# Render the compact skill listing for the agent's system prompt.
system_prompt = f"You are helpful.\n\n{skills.render_prompt()}"

# Progressive loading returns full instructions and relative resource paths.
loaded = skills.load("internet-research")
system_prompt += f"\n\n{loaded.instructions}"

# Re-scan the configured directories after skills are added or removed.
changes = skills.refresh()
print(changes.added, changes.updated, changes.removed)

# The application decides which general filesystem and process tools to expose.
guide = read_file(loaded.directory / "references/guide.md")
output = await run_process(
    ["python", "scripts/search.py", "python packaging"],
    cwd=loaded.directory,
)
```

`Skills.from_local_dir` accepts multiple directories; a skill discovered
later overrides one with the same name from an earlier directory (logged as
a warning). `SKILL.md` is re-parsed from disk on each `load`, so instructions
can be edited without restarting the process. `refresh()` rebuilds the registry
from the configured directories, picking up added, changed, and removed skills.
If discovery fails, the previous registry remains available.

`refresh()` returns an immutable `SkillChanges` value containing the registry
revision and the added, updated, and removed skill names. `refresh_if_changed()`
first compares a lightweight fingerprint of the `SKILL.md` paths, modification
times, and sizes, avoiding parsing when no skill document changed.

Agents that can write their own skills can attach `SkillRefreshMiddleware`.
By default it refreshes the registry after every tool that declares
`ToolEffect.WRITES_WORKSPACE`, silently and without touching the tool's own
result — so a newly added write tool is covered as soon as it declares its
effect, with no list of tool names to keep in sync:

```python
from agenttoolkit import SkillRefreshMiddleware

tools = Tools(
    context=ToolContext(skills),
    middleware=[SkillRefreshMiddleware()],
)
```

The registry is resolved from the call's `ToolContext`, not captured at
construction — swapping the context via `set_context(...)` or a per-call
`context=` argument refreshes the registry actually in use, and the
middleware is a no-op when the context holds no `Skills`.

Pass `when=` to select tools by any other predicate over the `Tool`, e.g.
`SkillRefreshMiddleware(when=lambda tool: "skills" in tool.tags)`.
Invalid skill edits are not activated and
the previous registry remains available. Applications that embed
`skills.render_prompt()` in model context should render that dynamic portion
again before each model invocation.

`load()` returns an immutable `LoadedSkill` containing `name`, `instructions`,
the absolute skill `directory`, and sorted relative `resources`. Resource
reading, process execution, timeouts, sandboxing, and permissions deliberately
belong to the application's general filesystem and process tools instead of
the Skills API. Skill directories and their scripts must still be treated as
trusted code.

## Development

Install the locked development environment and run all quality checks:

```console
uv sync --locked
uv run --locked ruff check .
uv run --locked pytest
```

The test command measures branch coverage for `agenttoolkit` and fails
below 90%. Dependabot groups Python dependency updates into one weekly pull
request; the same CI matrix validates every update on Python 3.13 and 3.14.
